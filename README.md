# 	A microbial mutualist within host individuals increases parasite transmission between host individuals: Evidence from a field mesocosm experiment

Authors: Kayleigh R. O'Keeffe, Brandon T. Wheeler, Charles E. Mitchell

Project summary: The interactions among host-associated microbes and parasites can have clear consequences for disease susceptibility and progression within host individuals. Yet, empirical evidence for how these interactions impact parasite transmission between host individuals remains scarce. We address this scarcity by using a field mesocosm experiment to investigate the interaction between a systemic fungal endophyte, Epichloe coenophiala, and a fungal parasite, Rhizoctonia solani, in leaves of a grass host, tall fescue. Specifically, we investigated how this interaction impacted parasite transmission under field conditions in replicated experimental host populations.
